					- Add CSS to cards
						- Base card will only contain the charity image and name
						- Active toggle for card to expand out, with the description/payment options/fund status appearing 
							- Need to create a state for the card to keep it active 
							- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42630473/react-toggle-class-onclick 
					- Each card should be rendered from database call
						- A key will need to be assigned to each card so that when the state is changed, not every card is getting affected
							- Only the card w/ its key should be changing in the state call
